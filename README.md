# College Costs Calculator


Financial literacy app project intended for the Changemaker category of the Code/Art competition.

This app is meant to educate college students about the costs of adult life. It'll inform users on the importance of budgeting, the implications and repercussions of certain financial choices, and rough estimates of their expenses (groceries, transportation, boarding, etc.). The members of our group are all from SAS, and so we know how important it is to get the facts on college life.
